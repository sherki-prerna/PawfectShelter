Developer's Note:
This project's purpose was completely different when I first started creating it during my first year —just me trying things out. Later on, I realized the idea was a bit cheesy, so I changed the direction of 
the website in my third year, I knew I wanted it to mean something, giving it a more purposeful and playful focus. So I kept the colors, the warmth, the playful gifs—but gave it purpose. 
Now it's a platform dedicated to animal adoption and awareness.That’s why the overall vibe feels wholesome, playful, and bubbly. I wanted to try a different aesthetic, and I hope whoever 
is reading this will be kind enough to appreciate the journey behind it.
